The Rmds will run the analyses.  
You might have to update the path to load the files from the share drive.  
I already wrote and commented the code to add B12 to the data, you just need to uncomment it. It should select the B12 value closest to germline and diagnosis.  
You will just need to add few plots/tables for B12 analyses.
